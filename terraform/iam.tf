# Creates two IAM roles — one for ECS, one for Lambda.
# These are NOT your F0zDEV user. These are roles that your
# AWS SERVICES use to talk to each other.
#
# F0zDEV = YOU logging into AWS
# These roles = ECS and Lambda identifying themselves to S3
#
# You never edit this file.

# ------ ECS Task Role ------
# Your FastAPI container uses this role to download model.pkl from S3
# Permission: read only from S3 (GetObject, ListBucket)
